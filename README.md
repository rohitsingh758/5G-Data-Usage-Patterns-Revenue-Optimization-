# 5G-Data-Usage-Patterns-Revenue-Optimization-
This project focuses on analyzing 5G customer usage data to understand user behavior, identify churn risks, and support data-driven decision-making for telecom businesses. The analysis was performed on a dataset of 350+ users, covering different usage types such as streaming, gaming, video calls, and downloads.

**Problem Statement**
With the rapid growth in demand for 5G services, telecom companies face challenges in understanding customer usage behavior, regional demand variations, and activity-based data consumption patterns. Limited visibility into these trends results in inefficient network resource allocation and missed opportunities to enhance customer experience.
This project addresses the need for data-driven insights into 5G usage patterns to support informed decision-making, improved network planning, and better customer satisfaction.

**Project Objectives**

The objective of this project is to analyze 5G user data and uncover meaningful patterns across regions, time of day, and activity types. Using Power BI dashboards, the project aims to:

1.Identify regions with the highest data consumption

2.Compare average data usage across different activities (streaming, gaming, work, browsing, video calls)

3.Detect peak hours of data usage to optimize network capacity

4.Provide clear and actionable insights to support executive-level decisions related to network planning, customer experience, and business growth

**Dataset Overview**

Number of Records: 350

Data Cleaning: Performed in Power BI

 **Key Columns Used**

Customer ID , Age , Region , Data Usage (GB) . Usage Type , Time of Day , Plan Type

 **Dashboard KPIs**

1.Total Data Usage: 8,950 GB

2.Top Data Usage Type: Video Calls

3.Average Data Usage per Customer: 26 GB

4.Highest Data Usage Region: Central

**Key Insights**

1.The Central region shows the highest demand for data consumption.

2.Video calls are the most data-intensive and frequently used activity.

3.Adult users consume more data compared to other age groups.

4.Data usage by adults peaks during the afternoon hours, especially for gaming activities.

**Recommendations (Business Actions)**

1.Increase network bandwidth during afternoon hours to handle peak demand efficiently.

2.Launch a 12 PM – 3 PM unlimited data pack to capture high-usage periods and improve customer satisfaction.

3.Target the Central region with customized plans and promotional offers to maximize revenue.

4.Introduce additional data add-on packs for high-usage customers.

5.Launch a ₹300 data plan bundled with free OTT subscriptions to attract and retain heavy data users
